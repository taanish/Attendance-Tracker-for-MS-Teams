Breaking down the attendance project 

1) The Programme reads a .csv file with the data of joining/leaving and stores it in some other easily traversable and readable format (lists)
2) As per user action, it calculates total join time 
    a) Everytime one kid is mentioned, they either join or leave. All odd mentions of the kid joining are Join and even mentions are Left. 
    b) for a kid who joins, leaves once, and joins back for the rest of the class: joinTime= firstLeaveTime -   firstJoinTime + classEndTime - secondJoinTime
    c) Figure out a way to generalise the second step to n joins and leaves
    d) All possible cases:
        --> Kid joins once and attends the entire class
        --> Kid joins once and leaves midway
        --> Kid joins once, leaves once, joins back, leaves again  (number of leaves and joins can be variable)
        --> Kid joins once, leaves once, joins back, doesn't leave 
3) If the total jointime is greater than some % of class time as set by the teacher, a present is stored for that student on a new csv/other format file
4) The new file with the attendance marked updates a google sheet url as provided by the user
